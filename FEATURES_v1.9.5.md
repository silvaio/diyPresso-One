# diyPresso-One v1.9.5 Feature List

## 🎯 Overview

Version 1.9.5 focuses on **temperature accuracy improvements** and **system performance optimization**. These enhancements will provide more precise temperature control and better system responsiveness.

## 🔥 Temperature Accuracy Improvements

### 1. Temperature Noise Reduction
**Problem**: Temperature readings can be noisy due to electrical interference, sensor fluctuations, and environmental factors.

**Solution**: Implement low-pass filtering to smooth temperature readings.

**Technical Details**:
- **Filter Type**: Exponential moving average (EMA) filter
- **Time Constant**: Configurable (default: 2-5 seconds)
- **Implementation**: `filtered_temp = α × new_reading + (1-α) × previous_filtered`
- **Benefits**: 
  - Reduces temperature spikes and noise
  - Smoother PID control
  - More stable temperature display
  - Better user experience

**Configuration**:
```cpp
#define TEMP_FILTER_ALPHA (0.1)  // Filter strength (0.1 = strong filtering)
#define TEMP_FILTER_ENABLED (true)  // Enable/disable filtering
```

### 2. Temperature Averaging System
**Problem**: Single temperature readings can be inaccurate due to sensor noise and sampling variations.

**Solution**: Implement rolling average system for more accurate temperature readings.

**Technical Details**:
- **Average Type**: Rolling window average
- **Window Size**: 10-20 samples (configurable)
- **Sample Rate**: Every 100ms (10 samples/second)
- **Benefits**:
  - More accurate temperature readings
  - Better PID control accuracy
  - Reduced temperature fluctuations
  - Improved brewing consistency

**Configuration**:
```cpp
#define TEMP_AVERAGE_SAMPLES (15)  // Number of samples for averaging
#define TEMP_SAMPLE_INTERVAL_MS (100)  // Sample every 100ms
#define TEMP_AVERAGE_ENABLED (true)  // Enable/disable averaging
```

**Implementation**:
- Maintain circular buffer of temperature readings
- Calculate rolling average for display and control
- Use filtered + averaged temperature for PID control
- Separate raw temperature for diagnostics

## ⚡ System Performance Optimization

### 3. CPU Load Sharing in Data Logger
**Problem**: Data logging can block the main control loop, causing timing issues and reduced responsiveness.

**Solution**: Implement non-blocking, time-sliced data logging to share CPU load.

**Technical Details**:
- **Logging Strategy**: Time-sliced logging (process small chunks per loop)
- **Buffer Management**: Circular buffer for log data
- **Priority System**: Control loop gets priority over logging
- **Benefits**:
  - Non-blocking main control loop
  - Better system responsiveness
  - More consistent timing
  - Improved real-time performance

**Implementation**:
```cpp
// Data logging state machine
typedef enum {
  LOG_STATE_IDLE,
  LOG_STATE_PREPARE,
  LOG_STATE_WRITE_CHUNK,
  LOG_STATE_FLUSH
} log_state_t;

// Time-sliced logging
void process_data_logging() {
  static log_state_t state = LOG_STATE_IDLE;
  static unsigned long last_log_time = 0;
  
  // Only process logging every 10ms to avoid blocking
  if (millis() - last_log_time < 10) return;
  last_log_time = millis();
  
  switch (state) {
    case LOG_STATE_IDLE:
      if (log_data_ready()) {
        state = LOG_STATE_PREPARE;
      }
      break;
      
    case LOG_STATE_PREPARE:
      prepare_log_buffer();
      state = LOG_STATE_WRITE_CHUNK;
      break;
      
    case LOG_STATE_WRITE_CHUNK:
      if (write_log_chunk()) {
        state = LOG_STATE_FLUSH;
      }
      break;
      
    case LOG_STATE_FLUSH:
      flush_log_buffer();
      state = LOG_STATE_IDLE;
      break;
  }
}
```
